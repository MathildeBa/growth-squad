## Why this app

here is the tast to join JAIMY's team. 

I had to make an app with Next.js That I never used bebore. Even if I'm pretty much autonom, I was stuck somehow. I realize that I didn't made the entire application but you will find what I would have sode on some comments. 
It was a great challenge to make this app. I enjoy made it.
